## 🎯 What It Does

👔 **Simulates Interviews** – Technical, behavioral, awkward silences? We’ve got you.  
🧠 **Smart Question Generation** – From "Tell me about yourself" to "Optimize this in O(log n)", it’s all here.  
🗣️ **Answer Analysis** – Your responses are analyzed for relevance, structure, and clarity.  
📊 **Feedback Reports** – Like a coach, but it doesn’t yell or charge $200/hour.  
🔁 **Unlimited Retakes** – Interview anxiety? Hit retry as many times as you need.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. You choose your **role** (e.g. Software Engineer, Product Manager, Data Scientist).
2. AI dynamically generates **questions** based on your level and field.
3. You answer (text or voice).
4. AI evaluates your response based on content, clarity, and tone.
5. You grow stronger. Like a job-ready Pokémon.
